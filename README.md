# Merchants and Marauders

This is my first project on github.

My objectives are:

- Learn about how to use Github

- Improve my C++ skills

To do this I will be making the game Merchants and Marauders, I have already made a segment of this game in Python for a University Project so I have an idea of how to code it up already but I am trying to use C++ here to sharpen my C++ skills. The game is quite a complicated game so I am not sure I will get to implement all of it however I will try to implement the core functionality. I will be trying to use lots of different C++ functionality where I can, I have programmed in C quite significantly and Python a decent amount but I am trying to learn C++, hence some of the way I do things might not be optimal in C++ so if you have any suggestions, please let me know.

It should be noted that this is an old game and it is out of print but can be bought from certain stores online. I have put the rule book in the repo called "game-rules.pdf"

At  a basic level it involves 2-4 players who take on the role initially of a merchant and travel to different sea zones in which they can buy, sell, recruit battle and more. The aim of the game is to reach 10 glory points where the first player to do this wins. Each player has a ship which they can upgrade at different ports. During battle, ships take damage and can be sunk in which case the player needs to buy a new ship. Different players have different captains with different abilities. The game is dictated by event cards which cause things to happen, i.e. NPC movement, storms etc. There are also mission and rumor cards which you can gain glory from. I may not implement all functionality but will try to implement core funcitonality which I have listed below:



Functionality I am attempting to implement:

- [ ] Sea zone movement
  
  - [ ] Ability to move between different sea zones
  
  - [ ] Ability to enter port, move from port and move to an adjacent sea zone on the map

- [ ] Port Actions
  
  - [ ] Ability to buy and sell goods
  
  - [ ] Ability to upgrade ships in port
  
  - [ ] Ability to recruit crew



During implementation, I will try to implement different design patterns and document when I have done this
